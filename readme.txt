== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What font is that?! And why is it easier to read?! =

See https://opendyslexic.org/ for more information; this plugin simply lets users toggle that font on or off.

It's very possible that font choice won't make a difference (https://www.dyslexia-reading-well.com/dyslexia-font.html) and as the OpenDyslexic website says, it "is not supposed to be a cure, a complete solution, or something you should apply uniformly to everyone". But for the sake of a checkbox, it's nice to have the choice.
